# VisioSourceControl
Module to support tracking the changes to a Visio documents xml representation over time.

After implementing the POC the amount of changed lines of XML when making one small change is so large that the meaningful information about your change is lost in the noise of cruft stylistic attribute changes.

Ultimately this didn't prove to be a worthwhile path to continue pursuing but in case anyone else can use this code I am putting it up here.
